# lovely text
This sends an email to phone number 'x' amount of times.

As of 4/30/17 this incomplete.

Update: The program works now as of 5/31/17
Update: The tweaked branch works now as of 6/5/17, This branch is now named lovely text.


With this script you'll be able to send a sweet email to a phone number from the command line. If you put the script as a cronjob then you can send sweet text everyday if you please. Fill up the external files (subject_list.json & body_comments.json) with nice messages and the script will randomly choose a subject title and message from those files and send them as a text message or email. There is also a file with common email-to-text phone carrier endings (phone_carriers.json) so those endings can be applied to the phone number. Imagine your mother or significant other receiving a sweet text every morning, that would light up their day!

Some ideas:
  - YOu can send emails as text messages and loop the sending process to send numerous messages at one time.
  - Put this as a chron job to send daily emails or text messages.

The only section of the code to worry about is the "this works" section. That is where you add your variables.

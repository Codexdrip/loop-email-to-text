# loop-email-to-text
This sends an email to phone number 'x' amount of times.
As of 4/30/17 this incomplete.

Update: The program works now as of 5/31/17
With this you'll be able to send an email from the command line.
Some ideas:
  - YOu can send emails as text messages and loop the sending process.
  - Put this as a chron job to send daily emails or text messages.
  - I've added many functions to the script, they exist to pull data from external files (subject_list.json, carriers.json, etc...) So you can add comments that randomly get chosen and sent as emails. I've added examples already.
But to send an email just fill in the variables.
